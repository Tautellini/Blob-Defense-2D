## Blob-Defense
<br>
<br>
Blob-Defense is a 2D Tower-Defense game with some unique mechanics.
<br>
<br>
A Tower-Defense-Game is a game, where enemy non player characters try to follow a path until they reach a specific destination.
If they reach their destination the player will lose a healthpoint.
The players goal is to prevent the enemys from reaching their destination by
building towers that will shoot on those enemys.
<br>
<br>
Our game will start at daytime. You have energy to spend on doing things like building, upgrading and mining.<br>
Since you only get a random amount of energy every round, the player has to think about his actions first. <br>
When the round actually starts, the time will switch to the night. The player has to make sure to have<br>
build enough lightsources on the enemy pathway for the towers to be able to actually see the enemys and shoot at them.<br>
