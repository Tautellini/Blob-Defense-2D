## Blob-Defense
<br>
Blob-Defense is a 2D Tower-Defense game with some unique mechanics.
<br>
A Tower-Defense-Game is a game, where enemy non player characters try to follow a path until they reach a specific destination.
If they reach their destination the player will lose a healthpoint.
The players goal is to prevent the enemys from reaching their destination by
building towers that will shoot on those enemys.
<br>
Our game will start at daytime. You have energy to spend on doing things like building, upgrading and mining.
Since you only get a random amount of energy every round, the player has to think about his actions first. 
When the round actually starts, the time will switch to the night. The player has to make sure to have
build enough lightsources on the enemy pathway for the towers to be able to actually see the enemys and shoot at them.
